# BMI Calculator

The BMI Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight inputs. It provides a quick and easy way to determine if an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## Features

- Calculate BMI based on height and weight inputs
- Display the calculated BMI value and classification
- Support for both metric units (centimeters and kilograms)

## Usage

1. Open the BMI Calculator website in your web browser.
2. Enter your height in centimeters.
3. Enter your weight in kilograms.
4. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to calculate your BMI.

## AI in Programming Phase

During the programming phase of the BMI Calculator, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques were utilized to optimize and enhance certain parts of the codebase. These techniques were applied in areas such as data preprocessing, algorithm design, and performance optimization. The use of AI assisted in improving the efficiency and accuracy of the BMI calculation process.

Please note that while AI was employed in the programming phase, the BMI Calculator itself does not directly utilize AI techniques for calculating the BMI value. The calculation is based on standard formulas and principles.
